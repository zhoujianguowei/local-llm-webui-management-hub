## 📋 Project Overview

This system (Hybrid LLM Management System) is a comprehensive management platform for locally deployed large language models, integrating **file management, user permissions, model scheduling, AI chat, and system monitoring** into one secure, efficient, and user-friendly solution.

Built on **Java + Spring Boot** (with Bootstrap 5 on the frontend), the system schedules local GGUF-formatted large language models through **llama.cpp** on the backend, while also supporting **OpenAI-compatible** remote API integration. Its core objective is to address cumbersome path permission management, model parameter configuration, and resource monitoring in local model deployments.

### ✨ Key Highlights

## 🌟 Feature Details

### 1. Deep Integration of the llama.cpp Inference Engine

**Optionally integrate ik_llama.cpp as an inference engine (not required)**: once its path is configured, you can switch between llama.cpp and ik_llama.cpp when starting a model. The ik_llama.cpp branch performs better in concurrent processing and acceleration of certain quantized models, providing extra flexibility for performance enthusiasts. (Note: automatic GGUF shard merging is still based on llama.cpp under the hood; shards produced by ik_llama.cpp need to be merged manually.)

![Model List](imgs/model-list-overview.png)

- **Multi-GPU Parallel Acceleration**: Full support for llama.cpp **SM Tensor** scheduling for multi-GPU parallel inference.
- **MTP Speculative Acceleration**: Supports **Multi-Token Prediction** speculative decoding, covering DSpark, DFlash, and MTP types, significantly reducing inference steps.
- **Multiple Quantization Formats**: Supports common quantization types such as F32/BF16/F16Q8_0/Q8_0, Q6_K, Q5_K_M, Q4_K_M, IQ3_XXS, and more.
- **Automated GGUF Management**:
  - Automatically recognizes sharded files (e.g., `model-00001-of-00002.gguf`) with one-click merge
  - Built-in naming convention checks keep model file names uniform (format: `model_name_quantization.gguf`)
  - Automatically matches `mmproj` multimodal projection files and `mtp` draft model files
- **Fine-Grained Startup Parameters**: 18+ tunable parameters including context size, GPU offload layers, parallel task count, tensor split, KV cache quantization, temperature, thread count, and batch size.
![GPU Configuration](imgs/model-gpu-config.png)

### 2. Intelligent AI Chat

![AI Chat](imgs/chat-main.png)

- **Conversation Management**: Supports creating new chats, loading history, deleting sessions, renaming, and pinning frequently used conversations.
- **Multi-Method Attachment Upload**:
  - File upload: supports uploading via copied file paths, as well as images copied to the clipboard; common text formats and image formats are supported
    ![Multi-Method Attachment Upload](imgs/multi-input.png)
  - Folder upload: supports uploading an entire directory listing. If the model supports image input, image files are included; otherwise only plain-text files are included
    ![Project-Level Code Analysis](imgs/chat-project-analysis.png)
- **Code Generation**: AI-generated code blocks support one-click copy, saving to local files, and collapsible display for long code.
- **Deep Thinking Mode**: Supports deep thinking for models such as qwen3.5, qwen3.6, gemma4, deepseek-v4-flash, and hy3.
- **System-Level Configuration**: Administrators can configure OpenAI API integration, model capability definitions (regex-based thinking mode on/off), and per-role limits on attachment size and maximum message count.
- **Conversation Statistics**: Real-time display of prompt prefill speed, decode speed, current context usage ratio, and other performance metrics.

### 3. File Management

![File Manager Main Interface](imgs/file-manager-main.png)

- **Smart Upload**: Supports drag-and-drop file upload and chunked upload for large files, with real-time progress display for each chunk and the overall percentage in the right task bar.
![File Upload Progress](imgs/file-upload-progress.png)
- **Flexible Download**: Supports downloading files or folders. Individual files download directly, while folders are automatically packaged into `.zip` archives in the background; compression progress is viewable in the download task list.
- **Multimedia Preview**: Supports online preview of multiple formats without download.
  - Images (JPG, PNG): full-screen view support
  - Video: Range request support, freely draggable progress bar
  - Documents (PDF): online preview support
  - Text/Code: preview support for common text formats including TXT, Java, Python, JS, HTML, JSON, YAML, etc.
- **Search**: Supports fuzzy filename matching with wildcards (e.g., `*.py`) for quick filtering of specific file types.
- **View Switching**: Toggle between list view (detailed properties) and tile view (suitable for image browsing).
- **Secure Deletion**: Deletion requires double confirmation, strict `DELETE` permission validation; protected paths cannot be deleted even by administrators.

### 4. Fine-Grained Permission System

![Permission Tree Management](imgs/permission-tree.png)

- **Path Inheritance Mechanism**: When accessing a file with no matching rule, the system automatically traces upward to parent directories until the nearest matching rule is found.
![Permission Edit](imgs/permission-edit.png)
- **Permission Cascade (Priority)**: **Delete > Upload > Download > Execute > Read**; higher-level permissions automatically include lower-level ones.
- **Dual Role & User Validation**: Each permission can be configured with a minimum allowed role, and also supports an additional list of specifically authorized users.
- **Path Penetration**: Even without execute permission on a parent directory, a file can be accessed directly as long as you hold read permission on the file itself.
- **Permission Tree Management**: Visual tree structure for a clear view of the system-wide permission distribution; quickly locate and modify permissions of specific subdirectories.
- **Path Protection Mechanism**: Protected paths display a special marker in the file manager UI, and all deletion requests are blocked outright.

### 5. Full User Lifecycle Management

![User Management](imgs/user-list.png)

- **Role Management**: Supports three roles — Admin, User, and Guest — with role switching at any time.
- **Status Control**: One-click ban/unban. When a banned user attempts to log in, an unban request workflow is triggered for the administrator to handle in real time.
- **Guest Validity Period**: Configurable default validity period (in days) for guest accounts; the system periodically scans and automatically bans expired accounts.
- **Self-Service Registration**: Once guest registration is enabled, users can register on the login page and receive a preset validity period automatically.

### 6. Real-Time Resource Monitoring

![GPU Monitoring](imgs/model-gpu-overview.png)

- **GPU Monitoring**: Real-time `nvidia-smi` parsing with data synced every 10 seconds and a trend chart of the last 60 samples, giving an at-a-glance view of each GPU's model and VRAM usage.
![Memory Monitoring](imgs/model-mem.png)
- **Memory Monitoring**: Real-time display of total, used, and available memory with overall usage percentage, plus a 3-minute memory usage curve to help analyze memory peaks during model loading.

### 7. Intelligent Scheduled Reboot

![Scheduled Reboot](imgs/reboot-add-detailed.png)

- **Dual-Mode Tasks**:
  - One-Time Tasks: automatically deleted after execution, suitable for temporary maintenance and single experiments
  - Periodic Tasks: configurable workdays with automatic next-cycle calculation upon expiry, suitable for daily scheduled shutdown/wake
- **Task Management**: View all created tasks including execution time, status (pending/running/expired), and real-time countdown; supports deletion or postponement.
- **Expiry Warning**: When a task is less than 10 minutes from execution, a countdown warning card pops up at the top of the page.

## ⚠️ Compatibility & Known Limitations

| Item | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Multimodal Capability** | The current version's multimodal capability **only supports image input**; audio and video input are not supported. |
| **Scheduled Shutdown/Reboot** | This feature depends on the underlying OS command set and hardware support; not all machines can run it properly. Tested environments: dual X99 (Ubuntu 22.04, E5-2696 v4) and Mac M1 Pro — shutdown/reboot work normally; Windows 10 64-bit (z690 motherboard, i7-13700K) — shutdown works, but automatic wake-up reboot is limited by motherboard BIOS and could not be woken up in self-testing. |
| **GPU Monitoring** | GPU monitoring depends on the `nvidia-smi` tool and **only supports systems with NVIDIA GPUs**. macOS uses Apple Silicon (M series) or integrated graphics with no corresponding monitoring interface, so no GPU monitoring panel is provided on macOS (memory monitoring is unaffected). |

## 🔒 Offline Licensing & Hardware Binding

The Ultimate Edition uses a **pure offline, one-machine-one-code, hardware-bound** activation mechanism. During operation the system is 100% isolated from external networks, with no data upload or backdoor dependencies whatsoever. Core components are protected with industrial-grade deep obfuscation and encryption, ensuring your private assets and code context remain absolutely secure.

**How the machine code is determined:**

- The system's physical fingerprint is computed jointly from your **CPU, motherboard, and operating system**.
- **Worry-Free Hardware Upgrades**: Routine hot-swapping or replacement of peripherals such as the **GPU, hard drive, RAM, or power supply** will **never** invalidate your license.
- **Re-Activation Triggers**: The machine code only changes when the underlying operating system is reinstalled or the core components (CPU/motherboard) are fully replaced.

**Version Compatibility Notes:**

- **Base and Ultimate Edition licenses are not interchangeable**: Base Edition licenses only work with the Base Edition, and Ultimate Edition licenses only work with the Ultimate Edition.
- **Same-Major-Version License Reuse**: License codes within the same major version series are interchangeable. For example, v3.1, v3.2, and v3.53 all belong to the v3 series and their licenses can be used across them.
- **Worry-Free Minor Version Upgrades**: Blocking bug fixes and minor optimizations are released as minor version upgrades; existing licenses remain valid.
- **Higher Version Licenses Are Downward Compatible**: A higher version license can be used with lower versions. For example, an Ultimate Edition v3.53 license is compatible with v3.1, v3.2, and all v2 and v1 series versions.
- **Lower Version Licenses Cannot Be Used with Higher Versions**: For example, a v1 series license code cannot be used on v2 or v3 series software.

### 🛒 How to Obtain a Lifetime License

All release packages come with a built-in **30-day full-feature free trial (Ultimate Edition Trial)**. After the trial expires, you can purchase the lifetime version through the dedicated channels below.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What is the difference between the Base Edition and the Ultimate Edition?**

A: The Base Edition is a minimal deployment version covering core features such as file management, user management, AI chat, and the permission system. The Ultimate Edition adds advanced features on top, including model management, resource monitoring, and scheduled shutdown/reboot. Licenses for the two editions are not interchangeable — see [Edition Comparison](#edition-comparison).

**Q: Why is there no GPU monitoring panel on macOS?**

A: GPU monitoring depends on the `nvidia-smi` tool and only supports systems with NVIDIA GPUs. macOS uses Apple Silicon (M series) or integrated graphics with no corresponding monitoring interface, so no GPU monitoring panel is provided on macOS (memory monitoring is unaffected).

**Q: Scheduled shutdown works on Windows, but the machine cannot wake up automatically to reboot.**

A: Wake-on-schedule depends on motherboard BIOS hardware support. Some machines (e.g., the self-tested z690 + i7-13700K environment) cannot be woken automatically due to BIOS/hardware limitations; the shutdown function itself is unaffected.

**Q: Will replacing my GPU/hard drive/RAM invalidate my license?**

A: No. The machine code is computed from the CPU, motherboard, and operating system. Routine replacement of peripherals such as the GPU, hard drive, RAM, or power supply does not affect your license; it only changes when the OS is reinstalled or the CPU/motherboard is replaced.

**Q: How long is the trial period, and how do I purchase a lifetime license?**

A: Every release package includes a 30-day full-feature free trial. After the trial expires, you can purchase a lifetime license via the [Wise payment links](#-how-to-obtain-a-lifetime-license) (Base Edition $9 / Ultimate Edition $19). Please include your machine code and receiving email in the payment notes.

**Q: Why does AI chat ask me to configure an OpenAI API?**

A: Ultimate Edition v1.1 and above supports automatic detection of locally deployed models, so no API configuration is needed. v1.0 or the Base Edition requires an OpenAI-compatible API to be configured before AI chat can be used.
